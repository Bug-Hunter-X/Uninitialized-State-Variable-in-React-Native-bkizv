This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: accessing a state variable before it's been initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  This error frequently arises during component mounting, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution involves careful state management and potentially using conditional rendering.
